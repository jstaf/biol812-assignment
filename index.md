# Assignment for BIOL 812 

Complete the three tasks below to finish your assignment (due Feb 7).

**Some useful resources:**

* [Git lesson materials](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)

* [Creating a website with Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

* [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

* [This website itself!](https://github.com/jstaf/biol812-assignment)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1 - Create a Github Pages website

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a super-neat service
from Github where they will host static websites
(no database or server processes running in the background) 
for free!

Create a Github pages website somewhere on your Github account.
If you don't have a Github account, you'll need to create one.

Hint: Creating an `index.md` Markdown file in a new repository 
and pushing it to Github is a great place to start.

## 2 - Answer the following questions somewhere on your website

1. When should you use Git for a project?

2. What kind of files/info should be saved in a Git repository? 
   What types of files/info should not be included in a Git repo?

3. What are the commands to undo a commit?

4. One of your repositories is in a "detached HEAD" state. 
   How do you fix this?

5. Your boss has no idea what Git is or why you are using it. 
   Explain the pros / cons of using Git for your research project.
   Explain the pros / cons of hosting your project in a public 
   (or private) repository on Github/Bitbucket/Gitlab/etc. 

## 3 - Submit a pull request

Add a link to this webpage by submitting a pull request to this
repository ([https://github.com/jstaf/biol812-assignment](https://github.com/jstaf/biol812-assignment)).
